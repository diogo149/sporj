Serializable functions with explicit, checked closures.
** Motivation
TODO
** Usage
TODO
** Inspiration
Inspired by Scala's [[https://github.com/heathermiller/spores][spores]].

The record structure is somewhat based on the structure of datomic's [[http://docs.datomic.com/clojure/index.html#datomic.api/function][function]] which is also serializable.
** TODOs
- midje tests
- figure out how to easily serialize/deserialize (transit?)
- better name (?)
